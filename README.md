## Data structures for everybody

Data structures for everybody is a collection of code written to understand and practice common algorithms we use day to day during our lives, how we append the list, how languages sort items efficiently, we will try to understand it all.

**Data Structures:**

1. **Arrays:** Static and dynamic arrays, operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. âœ…
2. **Linked Lists:** Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists.
3. **Stacks:** Basic operations (push, pop), and their applications (e.g., implementing function calls).
4. **Queues:** Basic operations (enqueue, dequeue), and different implementations (e.g., priority queue, double-ended queue).
5. **Hash Tables:** Understanding hashing, collision resolution techniques (e.g., chaining, open addressing).
6. **Trees:** Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and other self-balancing trees.
7. **Heaps:** Min-heap, max-heap, and their applications (e.g., heap sort).
8. **Graphs:** Basics of graph representation (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS).
9. **Trie:** Trie data structure for efficient string search and manipulation.
